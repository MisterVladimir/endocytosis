DONE
-------------
1. Load .csv and .zip ImageJ ROI (spun out to fijitools repository)
2. Load TIF image data (spun out into vladutils repository)
3. Simulate 2D images containing diffraction-limited spots modeled as Gaussians. Images can simulate EMCCD noise.
4. Storing camera metadata in YAML files.
5. Scripts to simulate images and save images (along with ground truth locations of simulated spots) as HDF5 files.
6. First version of neural net written.


IN PROGRESS
-------------

1. Optimizing neural net hyperparameters.
2. More organized and extensible way of saving simulated data.
3. Currently working on data visualization tool (see 'vsvis' repository).
