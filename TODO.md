DONE
-------------
1. Load .csv and .zip ImageJ ROI (spun out to fijitools repository)
2. Load TIF image data (spun out into vladutils repository)
3. Simulate 2D images containing diffraction-limited spots modeled as Gaussians. Images can simulate EMCCD noise.
4. Storing camera metadata in YAML files.
5. Scripts to simulate images and save images (along with ground truth locations of simulated spots) as HDF5 files


IN PROGRESS
-------------

1. Neural net to detect simulated spots: everything but the loss function has been written.
2. Optimizing neural net hyperparameters
